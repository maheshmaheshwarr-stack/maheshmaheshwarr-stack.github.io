# 20 Years of PeopleSoft: What I Wish I Knew When I Started

*A veteran's guide to mastering enterprise ERP systems and building a successful career*

---

## The Journey Begins

Twenty years ago, I walked into my first day at Oracle as a fresh-faced Applications Engineer, armed with a Computer Science degree and absolutely no idea what PeopleSoft was. Today, as a Principal Support Engineer at Rimini Street, I've supported over 30 global enterprises, resolved thousands of critical production issues, and witnessed the evolution of enterprise software from the inside.

If you're starting your PeopleSoft journey—or considering it—here's what I wish someone had told me back in 2006.

## Lesson 1: Master the Fundamentals, Then Specialize

### The Foundation That Never Changes

When I started, everyone said "learn everything." That's impossible and counterproductive. Instead, I focused on:

**Core PeopleSoft Architecture:**
- Understanding the three-tier architecture
- How PeopleTools really works under the hood
- Database relationships and data flow
- Security model and user access

**Pick Your Domain:**
I chose **Financials and Supply Chain Management (FSCM)** early on. This decision shaped my entire career. Whether it's General Ledger, Accounts Payable, Asset Management, or Procurement—deep expertise in one area opens doors everywhere.

> **Pro Tip:** Don't try to be a generalist in your first 5 years. Companies pay premium rates for deep specialists, not surface-level knowledge across all modules.

## Lesson 2: Production Support is Your Best Teacher

### The Real Education Happens at 2 AM

My biggest growth came not from training courses, but from those heart-stopping moments when a Fortune 500 company's payroll system goes down at midnight.

**What Production Support Taught Me:**
- **Troubleshooting under pressure** - When millions of dollars are on the line, you learn fast
- **Root cause analysis** - Surface fixes don't work; you need to understand the "why"
- **Communication skills** - Explaining technical issues to C-level executives
- **System interdependencies** - How one small change can cascade across modules

At Rimini Street, I've handled over 1,000 critical incidents. Each one taught me something new about PeopleSoft's quirks, limitations, and hidden capabilities.

## Lesson 3: The Technology Evolves, But Principles Remain

### From Client-Server to Cloud: What Really Changed

I've lived through:
- **PeopleSoft 7.x** - The client-server days
- **PeopleSoft 8.x** - Web-based revolution  
- **PeopleSoft 9.x** - Modern architecture
- **Cloud migrations** - The current reality

**The Surprising Truth:** The core business logic hasn't changed much. A General Ledger entry in 2006 works the same way in 2026. What changed is:
- Deployment models (on-premise → cloud)
- Integration capabilities (batch → real-time)
- User interfaces (character-based → web → mobile)
- Performance expectations (minutes → seconds)

**Career Lesson:** Focus on understanding business processes, not just technology. The tech will change; the business needs remain constant.

## Lesson 4: Soft Skills Matter More Than You Think

### The Consultant's Secret Weapon

Technical skills got me in the door. Soft skills built my career.

**What I Learned at Oracle, Wipro, and Rimini Street:**

**Client Communication:**
- Translate technical jargon into business impact
- Set realistic expectations upfront
- Document everything (seriously, everything)
- Follow up proactively

**Team Collaboration:**
- Share knowledge generously
- Mentor junior team members
- Build relationships across departments
- Take ownership of problems, even when they're not "yours"

**Continuous Learning:**
- Stay curious about new technologies
- Attend user group meetings
- Read Oracle documentation (yes, really)
- Experiment in development environments

---

## Lesson 5: The Industry is Smaller Than You Think

### Your Reputation Follows You

The PeopleSoft community is surprisingly small. The same names appear at different companies, conferences, and projects. Your reputation—good or bad—travels fast.

**What This Means:**
- **Always deliver quality work** - Shortcuts today become reputation problems tomorrow
- **Build genuine relationships** - The person you help today might hire you tomorrow
- **Stay professional** - Even when projects go sideways
- **Give back to the community** - Answer questions, share knowledge, mentor others

I've gotten three job opportunities through former colleagues who remembered my work from years earlier. Invest in relationships, not just technical skills.

## Lesson 6: Embrace the Chaos (It's Where You Add Value)

### Why "Boring" ERP Work is Actually Exciting

People think ERP is boring. They're wrong.

**The Reality:**
- Every implementation is unique
- Business requirements are constantly evolving
- Integration challenges are puzzles waiting to be solved
- Performance optimization is an art form

**The Excitement:**
- Solving a complex integration that saves millions
- Optimizing a process that affects thousands of users
- Preventing a system outage that would halt operations
- Designing a solution that works for the next decade

**Career Insight:** The companies that depend on PeopleSoft aren't going anywhere. They need experts who can navigate complexity, not just follow documentation.

---

## Lesson 7: The Future is Hybrid (Legacy + Modern)

### Why PeopleSoft Isn't Going Away

Despite predictions of its demise, PeopleSoft is thriving. Why?

**The Business Reality:**
- **Massive investments** - Companies have millions invested in customizations
- **Complex integrations** - Systems are deeply embedded in business processes
- **Regulatory compliance** - Switching systems means re-validating everything
- **Risk aversion** - "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" mentality

**The Modern Approach:**
Instead of replacing PeopleSoft, smart companies are **modernizing** it:
- Cloud migrations for better scalability
- API integrations with modern systems
- Mobile interfaces for better user experience
- AI/ML integration for intelligent automation

**Career Opportunity:** Position yourself as a "modernization expert" who can bridge legacy systems with modern capabilities. This is where the future opportunities lie.

## What I'm Working on Now

Today, I'm exploring how **Agentic AI** can transform traditional ERP systems. Imagine PeopleSoft that can:
- Automatically process invoices with intelligent validation
- Predict budget variances before they happen
- Suggest optimal procurement strategies based on market data
- Provide natural language interfaces for complex queries

This isn't science fiction—it's the next evolution of enterprise software.

## Advice for the Next Generation

### If You're Starting Your PeopleSoft Journey

**Do This:**
1. **Get hands-on experience** - Theory is useless without practice
2. **Join user groups** - The community is incredibly helpful
3. **Document your learning** - You'll reference it later
4. **Find a mentor** - Someone who's walked the path before you
5. **Stay curious** - The moment you stop learning, you start becoming obsolete

**Avoid This:**
1. **Don't chase every new feature** - Master the fundamentals first
2. **Don't work in isolation** - Collaboration is key in enterprise software
3. **Don't ignore the business side** - Technology serves business needs
4. **Don't burn bridges** - The industry is smaller than you think

## The Long View

### Building a Career That Lasts

After 20 years, here's what I've learned about building a sustainable career in enterprise software:

**It's not about the technology—it's about solving business problems.**

PeopleSoft, SAP, Oracle Cloud—these are just tools. The real value is in understanding how businesses operate and using technology to make them more efficient, compliant, and profitable.

**The companies that invested in PeopleSoft 15 years ago are still using it today.** They need experts who can maintain, optimize, and modernize these systems. That's job security you can't get in the latest JavaScript framework.

**The future belongs to hybrid experts** who understand both legacy systems and modern technologies. Don't abandon your PeopleSoft expertise—augment it with cloud, AI, and integration skills.

## What's Next?

The ERP industry is at an inflection point. Legacy systems aren't disappearing—they're evolving. The professionals who thrive in the next decade will be those who can bridge the old and the new.

Whether you're just starting your PeopleSoft journey or you're a veteran looking to stay relevant, remember: **your experience is valuable, your knowledge is needed, and your career is just getting started.**
